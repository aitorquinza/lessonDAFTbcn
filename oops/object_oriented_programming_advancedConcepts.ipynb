    "FUNCTION OVERLOADING\n",
    "\n",
    "Any class that you define has object as its parent class even if you don’t explicitly say so – so your class will have a lot of default attributes and methods that any Python object has. This is why you can just leave out the __init__ method out of your class if you don’t have any initialisation to do – the default that you inherited from object (which does nothing) will be used instead. If you do write your own __init__ method, it will override the default method. Sometimes we also call this overloading. The same goes for other special functions such as _str_ etc. These are also somtimes called magic methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of special object properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "__init__: the initialisation method of an object, which is called when the object is created.\n",
    "__str__: the string representation method of an object, which is called when you use the str function to convert that object to a string.\n",
    "__class__: an attribute which stores the the class (or type) of an object – this is what is returned when you use the type function on the object.\n",
    "__eq__: a method which determines whether this object is equal to another. There are also other methods for determining if it’s not equal, less than, etc.. These methods are used in object comparisons, for example when we use the equality operator == to check if two objects are equal.\n",
    "__add__ is a method which allows this object to be added to another object. There are equivalent methods for all the other arithmetic operators. Not all objects support all arithemtic operations – numbers have all of these methods defined, but other objects may only have a subset.\n",
    "__iter__: a method which returns an iterator over the object – we will find it on strings, lists and other iterables. It is executed when we use the iter function on the object.\n",
    "__len__: a method which calculates the length of an object – we will find it on sequences. It is executed when we use the len function of an object.\n",
    "__dict__: a dictionary which contains all the instance attributes of an object, with their names as keys. It can be useful if we want to iterate over all the attributes of an object. __dict__ does not include any methods, class attributes or special default attributes like __class__"
